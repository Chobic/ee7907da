Levels of change
Change impacts all levels of operations
Definition
There is no commonly agreed definition of Change Management, but
there are some accepted characteristics:

Type/classifications of change
There are two generally accepted types or classifications of change

Organisational change and organisational
transformation
There are significant differences between organisational change and
organisational transformation

IT-driven change and organisational change
management

Change management has changed
“The Post-Industrial Age is characterised by complexity,
uncertainty, and turbulence--an environment in which the
traditional boundaries and modes of operating are no longer
sustainable or relevant. This type of random, discontinuous
change—which, by definition, is fast, traumatic and
revolutionary—requires very different management and
leadership skills if the challenges it presents are to be handled
innovatively and opportunistically”
(Graetz, F. et al, 2002, p.17)

Three key Questions in Change Management
Research and Development
1. How successful are change management/transformation
efforts? (How do we measure success and failure?)
2. Why do change/transformation efforts fail? (is change failure
due to unique circumstances or are there common causes?)
3. What can organisations do to improve their success rate?
(Are some approaches more successful than others? Should,
and can organisations undertake less change?)
(Burnes, 2011)

Do 70 per cent of all Organisational
change initiatives really fail?

(Hughes, 2011)

•

History of Change Management

•

The contribution of the field organizational development

•

The most influential models and frameworks of organisational change and
transformation

•

Selecting the best approach

•

A strengths-based approach to managing change

History of Change Management

Defining Organization Development (OD)
• It is a planned change effort
• It involves the total “system”
• It is managed from the top
• It is designed to increase organizational effectiveness and health
(Source: Beckhard, 1969)

OD has tended to emphasize:
• Human development
• Fairness
• Openness
• Choice
• Balance of autonomy and constraint

(Source: Burke,
1997)

Criticisms of OD
• Unclear evidence that OD interventions actually work
• OD has over-emphasized process at the expense of
outcomes
• OD interventions not tied closely enough to the
corporate strategy and structures
• Organizations interested in radical/transformational not
incremental/continuous change
• OD perceived as unnecessary luxury
(Source: Burke, 1997)

(Al-Haddad & Kotnour, 2015)

Change methodologies
A general search of Google for “change methodologies” will return over 81
million results …

So how does a leader choose the best approach?
•

Adopt a foundational, research based framework (Bridges, Kotter, etc)

•

Define and confirm the business problem the change is addressing

•

Define the scope and context of the change

•

Identify critical success and risk factors

•

Choose or develop a compatible change methodology

Key characteristics of change frameworks or models

• They are all research-based
• They do not attempt to, or claim to, support any specific change methodology,
or any project management methodology
• They all assume the need for more detailed approaches and tools

Lewin, K. (1946)

Selecting the right change approach
An effective leader needs to be able to identify and adopt the most relevant
change approach, which means asking the right questions:

▪

Instead of focusing on what’s wrong, broken and needs to be fixed, focus on
identifying and harnessing strengths and the future

▪

This changes the questions you ask and the answers you get
•

Am I feeling tired today? OR

•

What makes me feel energised today?

Appreciative inquiry
Appreciative inquiry is an effective strengths-based change management

methodology
•

Key Assumptions

▪

Words create worlds

▪

Collaborative – co-creating

•

Inquiry leads to change – we move in the direction of the questions we ask

•

Transform the present by focusing on the future

•

Positive image – positive action

An Action-Oriented View of Organisational
Change
If:Organisations are “a coalition of interests and
a network of activities within a structure”
Then: “Change of one sort is always occurring
(guided & unguided; pro and con org goals).
Managers concerned with controlling events or
guiding change must be aware of networks within
and outside the organization.”

(Kanter, Stein & Jick, 1993)

Three Key Changemakers in Organisational
Change

(Kanter, Stein & Jick, 1993)

Why Transformation Efforts Fail

•

Not establishing a great enough sense of urgency
Not creating a powerful enough guiding coalition
Lacking a vision
Under-communicating by a factor of ten
Not removing obstacles to the new vision
Not systematically planning for and creating shortterm wins
Declaring victory too soon
Not anchoring changes in the corporation’s culture

(Kotter, 2012)

A Leader must Have a Strong Vision
“A great change vision is something that is easy for people to understand. It
can be written usually in a half page, communicated in 60 seconds, is both
intellectually solid but has emotional appeal, and it’s something that can be
understood by the broad range of people that are ultimately going to have to
change—and that could be a secretary or an executive, it could be somebody
from Germany or from the United States. Which makes it easy to communicate
and to communicate it in a way that people will “get it,” if you will, and will, if
you do it right, buy into it”.
(John Kotter, 2012)

...As well as a Clear, Consistent Message
“What leaders must do is to help employees and managers to recalibrate
their expectations,” David argues. “This is the world we live in now —
change is a constant. There is no ‘getting back to normal.’ The message
from leaders needs to be: ‘Let’s get ourselves in shape as individuals
and as an organizational culture to embrace the opportunities and to
manage the challenges of constant change in the dynamic world that we
live in. Let’s strive to become more resilient to accommodate that.”
equip ourselves together
(John Kotter, 2012)

Five Leadership Competency Areas in
Implementing Change
•
•

Creating the case for change – fundamental business need
Creating structural change – deep understanding, right tools and

processes

•
•

Engaging others in the whole change process in building commitment
Implementing and sustaining changes – effective plans, monitoring and

review processes

•

Facilitating and developing capability – challenging and supporting people
to find their own answers
(Higgs & Rowland, 2011)

Three Change Leadership Behaviours
•

Shaping Behaviour: the communication and actions of leaders
relating directly to the change

•

Framing Change: Establishing starting points and milestones

•

Creating Capacity: individual and organisational capabilities and
communicating and making connections

(Higgs &
Rowland, 2011)

The Four Dilemmas of Organisational Change
•

Adaptive or rational strategy development?

•

Cultural change or structural change?

•

Continuous improvement or radical
transformation?

•

Empowerment or leadership and command?

(Stace & Dunphy, 1994)

Leading Change: Primary Mechanisms
•
•
•

•
•
•

What leaders pay attention to & measure
How leaders react to critical incidents
and organisational crises
Observed criteria by which leaders
allocate scarce resources
Deliberate role modeling, teaching and
coaching
Observed criteria by which leaders
allocate rewards and status
Observed criteria by which leaders recruit,
select, promote, retire and fire

(Schein, 2016)

Leading Change: Secondary Mechanisms
•
•
•
•
•

Organization design and structure
Organizational systems and procedures
Organizational rites and rituals
Design of physical space
Formal statements of organizational
philosophy, values and creed
• Stories, legends and myths
(Schein, 2016)

View from the Top: ‘Level 5’ Leaders
“Are a study in duality: they are modest and wilful,
shy and fearless. They act with quiet, calm
determination and they rely principally on inspired
standards, not inspiring charisma, to motivate. They
channel their ambition into the company, not the
self. They also ‘look in the mirror, not the window, to
apportion responsibility for poor results, never
blaming other people, external factors or bad luck.
Similarly, they look out of the window to apportion
credit for the company’s success to employees,
external factors or good luck.”
(Jim Collins, 2001)

Leadership in Complex Environments
“Change results not from top-down,
preconceived strategic plans or
mandates of any single individual boss,
but from local actions that occur
simultaneously around the system
linking up with one another to produce
powerful emergent phenomena.”
(Wheatley, 1992)

The Leader’s Role in Creating Leadership in
Complex Environments
“Through the evolving process of
storytelling, strategic leaders achieve
innovation and change by demonstrating
its legitimacy and consistency with the
past. Maintaining this balance – between
the past and future, between stability and
disorder - allows organizations to evolve
and learn, and this is the essence of
operating successfully at the “edge of
chaos”
(Boal & Schultz, 2007)

Three Key Changemakers in Organisational

Change

(Kanter, Stein & Jick, 1993)

The Role of the Change Implementor
•

•
•
•
•

The activities of change implementors are pivotal to the success of change
management – they ‘make it happen’ and need to be ‘sold’ on the change
Their functions are clear: communicate and build support for change among
the ‘change recipients’ and provide input for the ‘change strategists’
However, the role of the strategic implementor remains highly ambiguous and
frequently precarious
Change strategists therefore need to manage “middle-up” communication
processes as well as “top-down and “bottom-up”
Political behaviour is still largely shunned by commentators, yet it is a critical
element in change agency
(Kanter, Stein & Jick, 1993)

Managing Mindsets During ‘Trigger Events’
“Managers often are confused by the change themselves and by the
questions being expressed. Understanding those adjustments,
anticipating the relevant and timely queries, and responding to the
mindsets at work is instrumental to effectively managing trigger events
for one’s self and for others in the company”
Pre-event: Managing the puzzle
Confirmation of the event: Managing analogies and comparisons
Occurrence of the event: Managing symbols
Passing of the event: Managing conclusions and learnings
(Isabella, 1993)

The Politics of Organisational Change
“Organizational political behaviour thus presents both positive and
negative, ‘nice and nasty’ faces to the observer-and to recipients
or victims. Not all ‘tricks’ are ‘dirty tricks’, although some ploys in
some contexts should be labeled as such. An adequate treatment
must explore both dimensions. A reluctance to address this topic
can be seen as naïve, in not recognizing positive aspects of
political behaviour, and can also be regarded as deceptive and
manipulative by suggesting that our attention would be better
focused elsewhere”.

(Buchanan & Badham, 1999, p. 625)

Engaging Middle Managers in Organisational
Change
• Middle managers are at the ”bleeding edge” – personally
needing to adjust to the change while also needing to be seen to
be supportive of the change
• Middle managers provide staff with the endurance needed to
continue through the change process

(Johnson & Hartel, 2014, AIM Discussion Paper)

Strengthening the value of Middle Managers
in Implementing Organisational Change
▪ Steady, continuous change vs delayed change then requiring
radical change
▪ Purposeful change with compelling reasons
▪ Communication which enables participation, demonstrates

empathy, support, open and just processes, and trustworthiness
▪ Skills in understanding, reading, interpreting and responding to
emotional clues (EQ)
(Johnson & Hartel, 2014, AIM Discussion Paper)

Strengthening the Value of Middle Managers
in Implementing Organisational Change
▪ Ability to engage staff through storytelling
▪ The ability to help staff align their own sense of identity to the revised
identity of the organisation

▪ Middle managers’ confidence in their own ability to successfully
navigate the change and help others to do so

▪ Skills in people management, communication, leadership, team
building, self management and relationship management (over and
above technical/specialist skills)
(Johnson & Hartel, 2014, AIM Discussion Paper)

Middle Managers are Pivotal in Promoting
Employee Engagement
Importance of employee engagement (applying discretionary effort, enthusiasm and
dedication towards their job and the organization they are a part of)

• If an organization values its people’s contributions, they reciprocate through
engagement

• To feel engaged at work people need (i) meaningfulness, (ii) psychological
safety and (iii) availability of resources

• Career development opportunities are seen as a sign of organizational support

• Support of direct supervisor critical to engagement
(Johnson & Hartel, 2014, AIM Discussion Paper)

Middle Manager Quotes from the Trenches
“Driving change through position power is a short duration lever only to be used if
personal integrity and respect is absent”

“Good intentions have a poor reputation”
“The value of any strategic change is realized only if it is fully implemented”
“Structural changes might be made but positive payoff will only occur when people
put their heart into the implementation program”

“Doing whatever it takes should not abrogate responsibility for ethical and moral
action. It is the sum of personal actions that evidence the real culture in an
organization. Inaction when aberrant behavior persists is tantamount to silent
compliance and is toxic to people and organisations alike”
(Johnson & Hartel, 2014, AIM Discussion Paper)

Three Change
Traps to Avoid

(Bendixen et al, 2017 CCL White
Paper)

Two Change
Derailers to
Avoid

(Bendixen et al, 2017 CCL White Paper)

A Values-Based Approach to Leading Change
“In complex, democratic settings, effective
leadership will entail the factors and dimensions
of trust, listening, authenticity, integrity, hope,
and, especially, addressing the true needs of
followers” (p.11)

“Moral and effective leaders listen to their
followers because they respect them and
because they honestly believe that the welfare
of followers is the end of leadership” (p. 9)

(O’Toole, 1995)

Turning Leaders into Coaches
IDEA IN BRIEF
THE SITUATION

THE CHALLENGE

THE SOLUTION

To Cope with disruptive
change companies are
reinventing themselves as
learning organisations. This
requires a new approach to
management in which leaders
serve as coaches to those they
supervise

In this new approach
managers ask questions
instead of providing answers,
support employees instead of
judging them and facilitate their
development instead of
dictating what has to be done.
But most managers don’t feel
they have time for that and
they’re not very good at it
anyway.

Companies need to offer their
managers the appropriate tools
and support to become better
coaches. And if they want to
be sustainably healthy learning
organisations, they must also
develop coaching as an
organisation capacity.

(Kanter, Stein & Jick, 1993)

The Vital Role of the Recipients of Change
“No organization can institute change if its employees will
not, at the very least, accept the change. …Change can
be ‘managed’ externally by those who decide when it is
needed and how it ‘should’ be implemented. But it will be
implemented only when employees accept change—and
the specific change—internally”
(Jick, 1990, p. 323)

Prosci – Individual Change Navigation

Resistance to Change
➢ HOW?:
- Absenteeism
- strikes
- reduced performance levels
- lateness
- negative attitudes
- errors
- waste and stealing
➔ WHY?:
- Lack of control
- Insecurity
- Force of habit change
- Exhaustion
- Loss

Resistance is Manifested in Many Forms
❏ Overt v Covert
❏ Conscious v Unconscious
❏ Individual v Group
❏ Passive v Active
❏ Temporary v Permanent
❏ Formal v Informal
❏ Legal v Illegal

Re-evaluating Resistance to Organizational Change
•
•
•

•
•

Faulty/unhelpful assumptions about resistance as “deviant behaviours”,
“an employee problem”, “a battle to be overcome”
Reframe resistance as the result of barriers that contribute to individuals
not fully adopting or embracing the organisational change
Resistance is the outward manifestation of the disruption to the pursuit and
achievement of Primary Human Goods (PHG) caused by organisational
change efforts
Organisations cannot satisfy all 11 PHG for each employee
Using a dialogic approach (i.e. asking people their stories) will help to
understand, and proactively problem solve, barriers for the priority PHGs
(Mathews & Linski, 2016)

The Eleven Primary Human Goods (PHGs)

(Mathews & Linski, 2016)

The Importance of Identity and Self in Organisational
Change
The Challenge: “Discrepancies between what people believe about themselves

and what others expect of them can lead to the fear that the self is under attack

… The intensity of a negative reaction varies from mild to extreme depending on
its perceived threat to self”
The Response: “Seek to understand where the person is coming from by
asking them about what matters to them, how they have come to the views they

are expressing, and why these are important. Shift from the content of the
conversation to the process of the conversation.”.

Stakeholder Analysis

Force Field Analysis

(Kurt Lewin, 1938)

Applying Stakeholder and Force Field Analyses
With respect to your Change Project Plan (Assessment 3) Business
Initiative:
• Use the Stakeholder Analysis Matrix to identify where various
stakeholders fit with respect to the change
• Use the Force Field Analysis to determine the ‘driving’ and
‘restraining’ forces
• Assign relative strengths to each force
• Determine steps that will be taken to disrupt the status
quo in order to realize the change you are proposing

(Kurt Lewin, 1938)

What Motivates Towards Change?

situations where negative information is available
to such an extent that termination appears to be
the rational choice”

Project management stages and processes

•

The role of the change management team

•

Change management risks and metrics

Benefits realisation management

Change Project Failure
Projects have a long and persistent history of failure.
Continuous research from 1990 to present

•
•
•

7-10 different research/consulting organisations
Worldwide, across most industries
Included ICT, strategy and process projects

Failure rates consistently in the range 50-90%

•
•
•
•

did not deliver benefits
over budget/schedule
did not deliver on time

complete failure

Contributors to These Failure Rates
The top three contributors to these failure rates are:

Lack of effective

Ineffective user

Unrealistic

leadership support

engagement

expectations

…which are all in the scope of Change Management

Project Success Factors
Research has also identified and ranked project success factors:

(Brown et al, 2016)

The People Side of Change
Change management is not a commodity

(Brown et al, 2016)

Attitudes and Phases of Project
It is possible to roughly plot related attitudes to the project against the phases of the
project

(Brown et al, 2016)

The Structure and Positioning of Change
Management
The structure and positioning of change management as, or in, a project are critical success
factors, and are driven by:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Type of change e.g. IT vs strategic
Perception of change, (i.e. commodity vs success factor)
Project methodology
Consultant/project management influence
Budget

Organisation history and experience with change
Politics

(Brown et al, 2016)

The Consultant’s Role in Change Management
“Business imperatives faced by management consultancy firms affect the
ways in which consultants influence organizational change
projects….management consultants aspire to form strategic partnerships with
their clients in order to win profitable business, and to plagiarise established
organising practices and change management methods in defining their
services in order to manage their costs…. These aspirations give rise to a

number of dualities that consultants face in undertaking organisational change
projects”
(Shaw, 2019)

Project Structure and Processes

Project Management Process

Key Change Roles and Accountabilities

The Change Management Team
The change management team is responsible for facilitating design and delivery
of…
• Integration with overall project (managing interdependencies)
• Communications
• Stakeholder Engagement & Management
• Leadership Alignment
• Benefits Realisation Management
• Training Design and Delivery
• Cultural Embedding
• Creating and managing the Change Network

Facilitating is the key word!

Change Management Team as Facilitator
The change management team is primarily a facilitator of the Change Network
•

Change must be “done” and “owned” by those it impacts

•

Change Sponsors and the Change Network are the owners of the change

•

The Change Management Team facilitates the Sponsors and Network
through:
- Preparation and Training
- Tools and Processes
- Support, Mentoring and Guidance

A Change Network
A change network will vary according to the project, but generally would look
like:

What is Benefit Realisation Management?
❖ “The identification, definition, tracking, realisation and optimisation of

benefits”
❖ A benefit is “the measurable improvement resulting from a change in
capability, perceived as an advantage by a stakeholder, which contributes
toward an organisational objective”
❖ A Dis-benefit is “the measurable decline resulting from an outcome
perceived as negative by one or more stakeholders, which detracts from
one or more organisational objectives”
(Jenner , 2014)

Benefits Realisation Management
Benefits realisation management is an emerging field:
❖ It is consistently identified as the least mature of project and program disciplines
❖ Approaches and methodologies are still evolving

❖ Practical “how to” experience is the major challenge
❖ Integration into existing Project and Program Management methodologies is evolving

… and the primary driver of this new discipline has been the failure rates of change
initiatives!!!!
(Ashurst & Hodges , 2010)

A Basic Benefits Realisation Management
Process
A Basic Benefits Realisation Management process will include:
●

Identify & Quantify

●

Value and Appraise

●

Plan

●

Realise

●

Review

…and will include both qualitative and quantitative benefits.

Qualitative Benefits
Qualitative benefits could include:
❖ Improvement in staff satisfaction survey results in qualitative areas
❖ Anecdotal evidence of decrease in gossiping
❖ Improved support for social activities
❖ Perceptible change in customer and public attitudes to organisation

… and these are as important as any quantitative benefits, as well as
having a direct impact on performance

(Ashurst & Hodges , 2010)

Why is it important?

Primary contributors to change fatigue in contemporary organisations

•

Reducing or preventing individual and organizational change fatigue

A Workplace for Zombies?
“The source of our monsters is technology
gone too far – to where we yield too much
of our thinking, communication, and
interaction to what our technology prompts
us to do. For many, our world is becoming
predictable and routine (almost brainless) –
and dare we say it: zombie-like. This is
especially true in the workplace”
(Perlman & Leppert, 2013)

Change Fatigue is a Very Real Problem
“Our latest survey with Corporate leaders into cultural transformation found that change
fatigue is one of the Top 2 challenges faced when building organizational cultures”
(Center for Creative leadership Blogpost, “Ditch Change Fatigue and Embrace Continual
Evolution”, 2019)

What is Change Fatigue?
▪ Change fatigue is broadly understood as the overwhelming feelings of stress,

▪

▪

exhaustion, and burnout associated with rapid and continuous change in the
workplace (Brown & Cregan, 2008)
Change fatigue is exhibited through employee’s passive acceptance of
implemented changes, brought about by feelings of ambivalence and
powerlessness regarding the change processes that so inherently affect their work
lives (Beil-Hilderbrand, 2005)
Change fatigue, contrary to resistance, has been described as passive behaviours
that often go unnoticed (Berneth, Walker & Harris, 2011)

Differences Between Change Fatigue and
Change Resistance

Some of the Contributors to Change Fatigue
•
•

•

•

Leaders who are either very high drivers or high
idea generators and often quite unaware that they
are pulling the trigger far too often.
Leaders who see change fatigue as just more
change resistance and continue on unchanged
with the same leadership behaviours.
Leaders who convince themselves that because
their goal is success, the difference between
change fatigue and change resistance is irrelevant.
This is not true.
Change fatigue will most likely occur when the
leadership vision is driven by the treasure hunt
syndrome or when the vision constantly changes.
(Nasser, 2018)

...Some of the Contributors to Change Fatigue
“ Leaders approach change as a shift from “Point A” to “Point B.” Along the way, the market

changes and the leaders recognize they need to move to “Point C” instead, then “Point D,”
and so on. Employees are called upon to constantly alter their behaviors and to take on
additional—and additionally taxing —responsibilities, without receiving extra resources or
relief from any of their responsibilities. They don’t have a clear sense of where their
organization is heading, what their role in that transition might be, or which elements of
change should be their top priorities.
To make things worse, leaders often tend to launch multiple change initiatives, even as
their existing projects are still in motion…. The well-paced marathon became 26 one-mile
sprints– the project team members were exhausted and employees were burned out."
(Perlman, 2011)

...Some of the Contributors to Change Fatigue
▪

The “Burning Platform” concept “- presenting a need as a “burning platform”, leading to
people focusing on the threat, scrambling, and talented people jumping ship before they
get burned

▪

Changing Strategy Now - expecting immediate change in response to market
conditions, often without a clear and compelling vision

▪

Separating ”the best and brightest” into project teams – leading to a sense of us and
them, separation from the business, project teams operating in silos from one another
on different change initiatives, and time lag between strategy – team set-up, and team
delivery.
(Perlman , 2011)

Individual Contributors to Change Fatigue
▪ Feelings of lack of control

▪ Unrealistically high levels of expectations combined with past failure
associated with these expectations

▪ Subsequent disillusionment arising from feelings of failure, fuelling
feelings of emotional exhaustion, inequity and burnout.

(McMillan & Perron, 2013)

Ways to Prevent or Reduce Change Fatigue Organisational Level
1. Take a whole-of-organisation approach to change. Not a series of independent

2.

3.

projects. Join the dots. Take a systems approach – recognise the flow-on
effects of potential changes and factor these in
Be clear about the intended outcome – identify and communicate something
clear, concrete and meaningful
Leaders, build your own capability in leading change. Do not delegate change
leadership elsewhere. Build change leadership capability and know that general
leadership capability during more stable times will influence the success of
change implementation.
(Turner, 2016)

...Ways to Prevent or Reduce Change FatigueOrganisational Level
4. Co-create the change with those who are going to be affected by it. Involve
people more. Don’t just limit involvement to the project team leading the
initiative.

5. Allow time for people to navigate their way through the change
6. Put in place change architecture/governance which identifies and monitors
which changes are taking place, their progress and their success

(Turner, 2016)

Ways to Prevent or Reduce Change FatigueIndividual Level
▪ Build individual capability in resilience and well being
▪ Build capability in acceptance (e.g. through acceptance and

commitment training methods)
▪ Build support networks, the sense of team, opportunities for

discussion

Or should that be the ‘RUPT’ World?

(Horth, 2019)

The Manager’s Key Task
“In all domains of life we struggle with the stable

instability of the living world. The manager’s task
is to make the best sense possible of the complex

responsive processes of relating, making the full
use of the resources available to him or her.

These include the mess, the ambiguity,
contradictions and paradoxes which arise from

trying to get things done with other people.”
(Mowles, 2015)

The Paradoxical World of Organisational
Change
▪

It is often difficult to see the presence of paradoxes in organisational life and
in a VUCA/RUPT world

▪

They are not problems that can be solved, as they are unsolvable

▪

They are of cyclical or recurring nature

▪

They can polarize individuals into groups

▪

They are potentially positive when managed

▪

Managing paradox involves developing a mindset beyond either/or logic (A
is either B or not B).

•

Role of technology and data analytics in change management

•

The features and benefits of a data-driven organisation

•

How data analytics/science are changing organisational change
Initiatives

The Data-Driven Enterprise

(KPMG, 2015)

Applying Data Science to Organisational
Performance
Google uses people analytics to identify the attributes of effective
leaders, predict the best hires, retain their employees longer, improve

diversity, drive collaboration, create successful teams, and increase
learning.

(Sullivan, 2013)

The Common Features of a Data-driven
Organisation
▪

There isn’t necessarily a singular path to becoming a data-driven company, but
there are some common features and benefits shared by those that get it right:

▪

Data-driven companies value the ongoing sharing of information. Collaboration is
a core tenant of the culture and it’s understood that all appropriate data should be
accessible to anyone in an organization - leads to improved situational
awareness and performance at the individual and team level.

▪

Employees have the tools and skills to make sense of vast amounts of structured
(data gathered in formal databases) and unstructured (information from emails or
presentations for example) data to inform decisions and make transformation
predictions.

(Gleeson, 2017)

The Common Features of a Data-driven
Organisation
▪

Data-driven companies make data collection a primary activity across departments – a
behaviour to be measured and rewarded.

▪

They have the ability to provide real-time insights as to where course correction may be
needed or new opportunities seized.

▪

Senior leaders not only buy-in to building a data-driven culture, they evangelize it from
the mountain tops.

▪

They use data to constantly diagnose existing systems and processes. When a
business case for change is made – it’s backed by data.

▪

They value transparency and encourage upward management and communication.

(Gleeson, 2017)

When Organisational Change meets Data
Science
▪

Maps the organization’s natural patterns of work
and social interaction using advanced analytics

▪

Matches the current patterns of work to the
changes that organisations are trying to implement

▪

Maximises success by developing solutions that fit

the organization’s natural patterns of work and
catalyses the networks to spur change

(Cullen-Lester & Wilburn, 2016)

How Organisations Work

How organisations say
they work

How organisations really
work

Developing the Network and Individuals
to Spur Change
▪

▪

First, they must intentionally develop change agents to help them use their own
connections and existing patterns of work in the organization to “engage
supporters, focus the majority of their attention on fence-sitters, and address
resisters with care”
Second, take targeted actions to rewire the network to better match the desired
organsiation change:
▪ Restructure the physical environment to encourage greater interaction/ideas
sharing
▪ Redesign formal structures to be better aligned with the informal ones
▪ Build a strategic change network
(Cullen-Lester & Wilburn, 2016)

Leveraging Change Agent Networks

(Cullen-Lester & Wilburn, 2016)

Becoming Data Ready for Future Organisational
Change Initiatives
▪ Know what you want to predict and collect large data sets that enable

you to do so
▪ Start using digital engagement tools (instead of traditional employee

opinion surveys) to monitor how strategies are being implemented
and received in real time and predict future success (e.g. waggl).

▪ Use data to select people for change roles based on a causal model
of the type of leader/change manager who leads successful change
(Tushman et al, 2017)

Becoming Data Ready for Future Organisational
Change Initiatives
▪

Draw upon social media analytics to identify stakeholder sentiment (i.e.
customers, suppliers & investors) – linguistic analysis can make inferences
about people’s behaviour from their word choices

▪

Capture reference data about change projects including who was engaged,
timing of implementation, strategy and tactics for implementation,
engagement, acceptance of, adoption of etc.

▪

Build a bespoke dashboard, develop partnership with the firm’s leadership
team to assess specific transformation investments
(Tushman et al, 2017)

A Future for Change Management?
“Change management will move from a project-based discipline

struggling to justify adequate investment to one that is advising on
business outcomes and how to deliver them. This should lead, at last, to

a decline in the one metric about change programs that we all know –
failure rate. Along the way we may finally solve the great puzzle of why

so many transformation efforts fail.”
(Tushman et al, 2017)

But Beware of Big Data Hype
“That HR analytics is one of the latest emerging fads is a paradox in

itself. The promise of analytics is great… (but) large parts of HR
analytics, however are not new... So far the published evidence

supporting the alleged value is actually quite slim – it is currently based
more on belief than evidence, and most often published by consultants

with commercial interests in the HR analytics market.”
